Please generate test cases that check whether an implemented solution
resolves the issue of the user (at the top, within <issue/> brackets).
Present the test cases as a diff (custom format, explained below).

The general format of a diff is as follows.
```custom-diff
diff
<path/filename>
< "rewrite" or "insert" >
< rough line number / EOF / BOF >
< insert function that should be added or rewritten >
end diff
< repeat blocks of diff as necessary >
```
Insertion can only be done at the end or beginning of the file, indicated by EOF or BOF respectively.

As an example for a diff, consider the following two versions of the same file, once before and once after a change.
The original version of the file was as follows.
[start of demo/test_file.py]
1 def test_euclidean(a, b):
2     assert euclidean(0, 0) == 0
3     assert euclidean(0, 1) == 1

7 @pytest.mark.parametrize("a, b, expected", [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 1)])
8 def test_gcd(a, b):
9     assert gcd(a, b) == expected

The diff for fix in function euclidean and adds the function gcd is as follows.
This diff changes the first file into the second file.

As you can see, you need to indicate the approximate line numbers, function name and the path and file name you want to change,
but there can be as many independent blocks of changes as you need. You may also apply changes to several files.
Apply as much reasoning as you please and see necessary. The format of the solution is fixed and has to follow the custom diff format.
Make sure to implement only test cases and don't try to fix the issue itself.

BASE_PROMPT = """
Please generate test cases that check whether an implemented solution
resolves the issue of the user (at the top, within <issue/> brackets).
Present the test cases in unified diff formatting.

The general format of a diff is the unified output format, described as follows.
The unified output format starts with a two-line header, which looks like this:

--- from-file
+++ to-file

Next come one or more hunks of differences; each hunk shows one area where the files differ. Unified format hunks look like this:

@@ from-file-line-numbers to-file-line-numbers @@
 line-from-either-file
 line-from-either-file…

If a hunk contains just one line, only its start line number appears. Otherwise its line numbers look like ‘start,count’. An empty hunk is considered to start at the line that follows the hunk.

If a hunk and its context contain two or more lines, its line numbers look like ‘start,count’. Otherwise only its end line number appears. An empty hunk is considered to end at the line that precedes the hunk.

The lines common to both files begin with a space character. The lines that actually differ between the two files have one of the following indicator characters in the left print column:

‘+’ A line was added here to the first file.
‘-’ A line was removed here from the first file. 

Insertion can only be done at the end or beginning of the file, indicated by EOF or BOF respectively.
